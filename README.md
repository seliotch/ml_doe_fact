# ml_doe_fact
four factor, two level factorial implmentation on machine learning fine tuning for accuracy and compute time response


NOTE
1) if you are using the original model.py file from jsearcy, you need to change line 50 of experiment_test.py to "learing" wherever it says "learning"

2) place this file in the mldoe "notebooks" folder

3) to run as a .py it needs to be in comand prompty (on talapas server), if you want to run it as an interactive then copy and paste the contents to a new ipynb file in talapas

4) if some sort of error occurs but it seems that the model may have been trained and evaluated use print(rep1_outlist) in a seperate execution box, but in the same file, it might contain the values
